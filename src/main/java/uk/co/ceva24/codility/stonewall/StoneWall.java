        * so when we find two indices that are of the same height, we can use the same block, providing all the values in-between are higher.
        *
        * if we find a lower value, end the block.
        
        * idea - store a list of currently-active blocks. next interations can build upon top of these.
        * once the height of an index is lower than an active block, remove that block from activity, and add a new block equaling the index's height
        * to the active list.
        
        * are we able to accurately track the number of blocks used by doing this?
        
        * Must be O(N) - no inner loops.
        * no addition or multiplication - should be safe using ints rather than longs.
        
        
        
        * extra - can we store blocks individual heights in the list rather than total height? an int tracking total height?
